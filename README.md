## 📢 Coming Soon!

> **Our team is currently organizing the technical codebase and will be open-sourcing it soon. Stay tuned!**

## 🌟 Overview

HyperSpectral-M is a comprehensive framework for advanced signal processing and analysis, incorporating state-of-the-art techniques including signal disentanglement mechanisms, spectral decomposition, and physics-constrained reconstruction paradigms.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Signal Disentanglement Mechanism (SDM)**: Separates complex signals into interpretable components
- **Spectral Decomposition (SD)**: Analyzes signal properties across multiple frequency bands
- **Physics-Constrained Reconstruction Paradigm (PCRP)**: Ensures outputs conform to physical constraints

## 📊 Performance Highlights

- SDM module: 15% reduction in MAE compared to baseline
- SD module: 8% additional performance improvement
- PCRP module: 5% further enhancement in accuracy
- Optimal parameters: K=8 frequency bands, λ=0.1 for manifold alignment

## 📋 Implementation Timeline

- [x] Core algorithm development
- [x] Internal testing and validation
- [x] Documentation preparation
- [ ] Code organization and cleanup
- [ ] Public repository launch
- [ ] Community guidelines establishment
- [ ] Extended examples and tutorials
